Week 0: 
* hyperparamter tuning for xgboost model may affect accuracy, but more importantly, most important feature selection
* understand information theory approach and implement that
* compare and contrast xgboost vs information theory approach
* compare metrics (f1 score, accuracy, etc) for xgboost features vs information theory features

* possibly test new set of features with lstm model?
